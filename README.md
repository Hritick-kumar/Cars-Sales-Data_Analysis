# 📊 Sales Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Sales Data Analysis** project! 🚀 In this project, I consolidated 3 years of sales data from 36 CSV files into a comprehensive sales fact table. I also created 3 lookup tables to enrich the data with information about car models, sales representatives, and regions. 

## 📋 Overview

This project aims to provide a thorough analysis of sales performance by integrating and processing extensive datasets. The result is a unified sales fact table that facilitates detailed and insightful analysis.
